# Translations
These translations are meant to be used by the userscript, providing a json like [en.json](https://github.com/IDotD/Translations/blob/master/en.json) for each language.

The names of the files are defined by [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) and use the two-letter code.

We prefer forks of this repository and pull requests if you plan to help.
